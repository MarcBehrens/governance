\section*{\underline{Discussion}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Approval of splitting WP3 (FPP v.2.2) into a new and smaller WP3 and a
new WP7 (FPP v.3.0).

Result: approved

\item Shifting of various deliverable according to the following options:
\begin{itemize}

\item Option 1:  The end date of the project will not be extended and we keep
it June 30, 2015 (default option; potentially ask later for an extension)
\item Option 2:  The end date of the project will be extended to Dec. 31,
2015 (+ 6 Month)
\item Option 3:  The end date of the project will be extended to June 30,
2016 (+12 Month)
\end{itemize}

No matter what option is intended to be chosen, the cost of the project
will not change with respect to public funding .

Due to the importance of this decision we would like to have parties be
present or represented by a proxy that represent at least 50% of the
project share, 30% is the agreed minimum.\\
This decision requires a 75% (3 out of 4) majority to be valid. Parties
whose obligations are effected can veto this decision.\\

Parties who intend to veto this decision are requested to provide an
alternative plan, which do not effect their overall cost by adapting their
contributions within the new timeline.\\

Result:

All participants agreed a completion of the project as currently planned
is not likely.
However, there was no common agreement on the amount of extra time needed.
Result of the vote on the topic:

Option 1: 8 votes\\
Option 2: 5 votes\\
Option 3: 5 votes.\\

Conclusion: with this result the "status quo", which is option 1, is valid
until a further formal request for changing the schedule is proposed.
